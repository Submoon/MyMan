# MyMan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Submoon/MyMan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Submoon/MyMan)
MyMan is a custom bot written with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) written by a little team of developers on their free time.

It aims to provide some cool functionalities to its users.

It is still in heavy development, and is actually hosted on a raspberry pi, so it may be really slow.

If you still want to try it, you can invite it with [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=402755102735073280&permissions=2146958448&scope=bot)

## Usage
Available commands are available with the command !help and you can get specific help with !help command_name

Help is provided by a RichEmbed via private message, so please authorize Rich Embeds on your discord client.

## Contributing
Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at [Submoon's Github](https://github.com/Submoon/MyMan).

If you are interested in helping the team on the development, you can try to tackle one of the issues and ask for a pull request when it's over.

Or you can just add a new functionality completely.

## Installation

### Because of discord.js
Node.js 8.0.0 or newer is required.

Ignore any warnings about unmet peer dependencies, as they're all optional.
